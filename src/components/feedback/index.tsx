        This passion project was created with the intention to have an easily
        accessible and searchable dictionary of well-known dance moves and
        foundations in hopes of aiding dancers with their training (and my own
        training ðŸ™ˆ). This is very much still a WIP. If you would like to
        suggest a move, suggest a feature, or leave constructive feedback,
        please fill out the form below.
